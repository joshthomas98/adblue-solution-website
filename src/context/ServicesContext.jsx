    name: "Stage 2 Tuning",
    shortDescription:
      "Enhanced performance with additional hardware and software modifications.",
    description:
      "Stage 2 tuning usually builds upon Stage 1 by incorporating additional hardware modifications, such as upgraded intake and exhaust systems, intercoolers, and turbochargers. This allows for more aggressive tuning and higher power gains compared to Stage 1.",
